         Coding and software development has become an interest of mine as I have come to realize that computers are the new frontier of human development.

         I am an avid rock climber, and have been climbing since my dad first put me on a wall a couple decades ago. I find the time to boulder several times a week, and love the challenge of it. Each route is a puzzle, that requires the right footwork, balance, strength, and decision making. Often times a previously impossible climb becomes possible as I try a new series of hand and foot movements.
